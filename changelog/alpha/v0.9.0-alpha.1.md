# Version 0.9.0-alpha.1 - Dummy Modules for Validation

**Release Date**: 2025-11-22
**Workflow Phase**: ALPHA
**Type**: Feature (MINOR bump)

---

## Summary

Created two simple dummy modules (producer and consumer) that communicate via EventBus to validate the entire orchestration system. These modules serve as examples and testing tools to ensure module loading, event bus communication, and lifecycle management work correctly.

---

## Changes

### Added
- **mod-dummy-producer Module**: Background thread publishing test.ping events
  - Publishes events periodically (configurable interval, default 5 seconds)
  - Event payload includes message, timestamp, and counter
  - Uses threading.Event for interruptible sleep (clean shutdown)
  - Implements initialize(), shutdown(), and get_tests() hooks
  - 104 lines of code

- **mod-dummy-consumer Module**: EventBus subscriber for test.ping events
  - Subscribes to configured events during initialization
  - Logs received events with full data payload
  - Tracks subscriptions for proper cleanup
  - Implements initialize(), shutdown(), and get_tests() hooks
  - 78 lines of code

- **Module Tests**: Unit tests for both modules
  - Producer tests: verify event publishing and shutdown behavior
  - Consumer tests: verify subscription and unsubscription
  - 2 tests per module, 4 total tests passing

- **Configuration**: Added both modules to modules.yaml
  - Producer configured with publish_interval and event_type
  - Consumer configured with subscribe_events list
  - Both modules enabled by default
  - Absolute paths used for module loading

### Mission Details

## User Feedback (Step A9)

**Feedback Status**: Positive - Module communication working correctly
- Producer publishes events successfully in background thread
- Consumer receives and logs events via EventBus
- All 7 tests passing (3 main app + 2 producer + 2 consumer)
- Graceful shutdown stops publisher and unsubscribes consumer
- Test mode successfully discovers and runs all module tests

## Files Changed

### Files Created
- `modules-backend/mod-dummy-producer/__init__.py` (104 lines)
- `modules-backend/mod-dummy-producer/tests/test_producer.py` (37 lines)
- `modules-backend/mod-dummy-consumer/__init__.py` (78 lines)
- `modules-backend/mod-dummy-consumer/tests/test_consumer.py` (37 lines)

### Files Modified
- `config/modules.yaml` (32 lines, +18 lines)

---

## Testing

### Manual Validation
- **Module Loading**: Both modules load and initialize successfully
- **Event Communication**: Producer publishes events every 5 seconds, consumer receives and logs
- **Test Mode**: All 4 module tests discovered and passed
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean shutdown with no errors or warnings

### Test Coverage
- **Tests Added**: 4 new tests (2 producer, 2 consumer)
- **Total Tests**: 7 passing
- **Status**: All passing

---

## Technical Implementation

### Producer Module Features
- Background thread with daemon mode for event publishing
- Threading.Event for clean shutdown signaling
- Configurable publish interval and event type
- Event counter tracking
- Interruptible sleep using Event.wait(timeout)

### Consumer Module Features
- Dynamic event subscription from configuration
- Subscription tracking for proper cleanup
- Event handler logging received data
- Complete unsubscription on shutdown

### Module System Validation
- Validates Feature-004 (Module Loading & Lifecycle)
- Validates Feature-007 (Test Mode Implementation)
- Demonstrates EventBus pub/sub communication
- Proves module hot-reload system works (if Feature-005 active)
